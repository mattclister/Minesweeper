The aim of this project was to write minesweeper without any research on how minesweeper works, from my memory of the game.
I itend to write it first: Using only JS, HTML and CSS.

My aim is to better understand how frameworks and other JS tools, can be useful, and what they could simplify.

------ PROGRESS -------
- So far I have a working version of minesweeper, using only JS, HTML and CSS. You can view it here: https://codepen.io/mattclister/pen/PovLxaW

------ NOTES ----------
- There is refactoring I should do.
- There was a good amount of debugging to create this as I had got some indexes the wrong way round.
