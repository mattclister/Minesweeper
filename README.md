The aim of this project was to write minesweeper without any research on how minesweeper works, from my memory of the game.
I itend to write it first: Using only JS, HTML and CSS.
Second: With SASS, JQuery / Bootstrap
Third with: React and any other tools

My aim is to better understand how frameworks and other JS tools, can be useful.
